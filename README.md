# Vagrant provider for Debian Stable (slim version)

I got tired of getting non-docker Vagrant providers to run, so to ease dev with Debian I went with the self-built route.

The Dockerfile is based on the work by [Matt Dark](https://dev.to/mattdark/using-docker-as-provider-for-vagrant-10me), thanks!

The container is built based on [Debian Stable Slim](https://hub.docker.com/_/debian) version
